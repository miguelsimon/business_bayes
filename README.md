## Overview

There are some problems I encounter in my day job with the following properties:
* they pop up again and again, they're common in different contexts
* they are subtler than they appear at first & are related to probability: I'm not really sure if my solutions are good or not
* I feel most peoples's approaches to these problems are suboptimal
* I keep reimplementing slightly different solutions in ipython notebooks and giving napkin explanations of questionable clarity

* **Are today's sales lower than yesterday's because of random fluctuation, or should I be worried?**
  * problem description: [day_to_day_sales.ipynb](day_to_day_sales.ipynb)
  * implementation: TODO
